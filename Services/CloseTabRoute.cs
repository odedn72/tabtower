/// positive match only while the session has a panel, i.e. while its process is alive. For a
/// session whose process died without the deck hearing of it, the reveal resumes it off its
/// transcript or does nothing at all, and what is in front afterwards is some other tab. On
/// 17-10-2026 a burst of such requests closed a live tab that no request had named. So a
/// session that the registry shows as gone is a no-op with a log line: no reveal, no tab
/// touched. When the registry cannot answer (an older Claude Code), the by-id path stands as
/// before; the connector serialises its commands (0.7.1), which removes the other half of what
